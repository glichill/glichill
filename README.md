# Hi there, I'm Giulia 👋

I started my academic journey studying mathematics, but it was when I delved into programming that I discovered my passion for the world of data science. On my GitHub, you'll find some of the projects I've worked on during my academic courses.

## About Me

- 🌱 I'm currently a student at Politecnico di Torino, pursuing a master's degree in Mathematical Engineering.
- 💼 I'm currently interning as a Junior Data & AI Consultant, where I'm also working on my master's thesis.
- 👥 I'm interested in collaborating on Data Science projects, Python scripts, and open-source initiatives.
- 🏔️ I'm an outdoor enthusiast who loves to explore and meet new people every day.
- 🧘🏻‍♀️ I'm a yoga addict; for me, a clear mind means clear code!

Feel free to explore my projects and get in touch. I'm always excited to connect and collaborate on interesting data-driven projects!
